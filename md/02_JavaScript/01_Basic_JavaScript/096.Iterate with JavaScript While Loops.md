# 096.Iterate with JavaScript While Loops

### [ Notes ]
  * while() loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.
  * loop is a way to execute the same code as much as needed.

#### while() loop

```sh
let index = 5;
while (index > 0) {
  outputArray.push(index);
  index--;
}
console.log(outputArray);
```

#### output
```sh
[ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ]
```

#### example #2

```sh
let index = 0;

while (index < 5) {
  outputArray.push(index);
  index++;
}

console.log(outputArray);
```

#### output
```sh
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to `myArray` using a `while` loop.

### [ before ]

```sh
// Setup
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
let index = 5;
while (index >= 0) {
  myArray.push(index);
  index--;
}
console.log(myArray);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
[ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ]
```
