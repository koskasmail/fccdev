000. Data Structures

### Data Structures 
* Data Structures is a way of `organizing`, `storing`, `managing`, `manipulate` data.
    * JavaScript data structures: `arrays`, `objects` .
    * JavaScript methods like `splice()` , `Object.keys()`.

**Data Structures** are fundamental concepts in computer science that refer to ways of organizing, storing, and managing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are essential for creating efficient algorithms and optimizing the performance of software applications.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some common types of data structures:

### 1. **Arrays**
   - **Description**: A collection of elements identified by index or key. All elements in an array are of the same type.
   - **Example**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

### 2. **Linked Lists**
   - **Description**: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Types**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
   - **Example**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

### 3. **Stacks**
   - **Description**: A collection of elements with two main operations: push (add an element) and pop (remove the most recently added element). It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
   - **Example**: A stack of plates where you can only take the top plate.

### 4. **Queues**
   - **Description**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
   - **Example**: A line of people waiting for a service.

### 5. **Trees**
   - **Description**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes. Each node has zero or more children.
   - **Types**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps.
   - **Example**: A family tree.

### 6. **Graphs**
   - **Description**: A set of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and can represent complex relationships.
   - **Example**: A network of roads connecting cities.

### 7. **Hash Tables**
   - **Description**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for fast data retrieval using a hash function.
   - **Example**: A dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value).

### 8. **Heaps**
   - **Description**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, the parent node is greater than or equal to the child nodes; in a min heap, the parent node is less than or equal to the child nodes.
   - **Example**: A priority queue.

### Importance of Data Structures:
- **Efficiency**: Choosing the right data structure can significantly reduce the complexity of an algorithm.
- **Memory Management**: Proper use of data structures can optimize the use of memory.
- **Ease of Use**: Some data structures provide easier ways to handle data (e.g., stacks and queues).

Data structures are the building blocks for designing efficient algorithms and are crucial in areas like databases, operating systems, artificial intelligence, and more.
