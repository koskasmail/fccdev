# 028.Handle a Fulfilled Promise with `then`

### [ Notes ]
  * `then` method method is `executed immediately` after your promise is fulfilled (get result) with `resolve`.
  * `result` comes from the argument given to the `resolve` method.

#### example: `then` method.

```sh
myPromise.then(result => {
  
});
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Add the `then` method to your promise.
  2. Use `result` as the parameter of its callback function and log `result` to the console.

### [ before ]

```sh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then (result => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
We got the data
```
