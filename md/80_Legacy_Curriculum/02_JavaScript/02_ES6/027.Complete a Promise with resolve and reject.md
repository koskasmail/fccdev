# 027.Complete a Promise with resolve and reject

### [ Notes ]
  * A `promise` has three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`.
  * The `resolve` and `reject` parameters given to the promise argument.
  * `resolve` is used when you want your promise to `succeed`.
  * `reject` is used when you want  your promise to `fail`.

#### example #1

```sh
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if(condition here) {
    resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
  } else {
    reject("Promise was rejected");
  }
});
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Make the `promise` handle success and failure.
  2. If `responseFromServer` is `true`, call the `resolve` method to `successfully` complete the promise. Pass `resolve` a string with the value `We got the data`.
  4. If `responseFromServer` is `false`, use the `reject` method instead and pass it the string: `Data not received`.

### [ before ]

```sh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
  let responseFromServer;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    // Change this line
  } else {  
    // Change this line
  }
});
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
  let responseFromServer;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    // Change this line
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    // Change this line
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});
```

### [ solution #2 ]

```sh
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    // Change this line
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    // Change this line
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then (result => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
We got the data
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. The `resolve` (succeed) and `reject` (fail) parameters given to the promise argument.
