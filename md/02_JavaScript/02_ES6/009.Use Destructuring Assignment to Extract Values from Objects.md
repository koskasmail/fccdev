# 009.Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

### [ Notes ]
  * Destructuring assignment assign values taken directly from an object

#### example ES5:

```sh
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;

console.log(name + " " + age);
```

#### output
```sh
John Doe 34
```

#### example ES6:

```sh
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name + " " + age);
```

#### output
```sh
John Doe 34
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment.
     It should still assign the variables today and tomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.

### [ before ]

```sh
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line

const today = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const tomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow;

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line

const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

console.log(today);
console.log(tomorrow);

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
77
80
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. Destructuring assignment assign values to a variable taken directly from an object
