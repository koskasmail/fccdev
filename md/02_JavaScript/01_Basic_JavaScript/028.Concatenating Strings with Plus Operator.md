# 028.Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

### [ Notes ]
  * concatenation operator `+` is used to build a new string from other strings by sticking them together (concatenating them).

#### example #1

```sh
var string1 = "welcome";
var string2 = 'back';

console.log(string1 + " - " + string2);
```

#### output
```sh
welcome - back
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Build `myStr` from the strings `This is the start`. and `This is the end.` using the `+` operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.

### [ before ]

```sh
const myStr = ""; // Change this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."; // Change this line
console.log(myStr);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
This is the start. This is the end.
```
