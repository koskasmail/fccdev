# 029.Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

### [ Notes ]
  * `+=` operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable (break a long string over several lines).

#### example #1

```sh
let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

console.log(ourStr);
```

#### output
```sh
I come first. I come second.
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Build `myStr` over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
     * `This is the first sentence.` -and- `This is the second sentence.`
  * using the `+=` operator. Use the `+=` operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings.
  * Start by assigning the first string to `myStr`, then add on the second string.

### [ before ]

```sh
let myStr;
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.
```
