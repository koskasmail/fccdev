# 000.00.Debugging

* Debugging is the process of going through the code to find the bug/error so you can trace and fix them.

* Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
   * syntax errors - prevent your program from running, 
   * runtime errors - code execute in unexpected behavior.
   * logical errors -  code do somthing diffrent then expected.
