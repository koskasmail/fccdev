# 007.Match Anything with Wildcard Period

### [ Notes ]
  * [`.`] - wildcard character will match any one character.
  * wildcard character is a dot/period [`.`]

#### [`.`] - wildcard character - /th./
```sh
let testString = "is this that thing, they got ?";
let repeatRegex = /th./;
console.log(testString.match(repeatRegex)); 
```

#### output
```sh
[ 'thi',
  index: 3,
  input: 'is this that thing, they got ?',
  groups: undefined ]
```

#### /th./g
```sh
let testString = "is this that thing, they got ?";
let repeatRegex = /th./g;
console.log(testString.match(repeatRegex)); 
```

#### output
```sh
[ 'thi', 'tha', 'thi', 'the' ]
```

#### /.hi/g
```sh
let testString = "this hint thin being a thing";
let repeatRegex = /.hi/g;
console.log(testString.match(repeatRegex)); 
```

#### output
```sh
[ 'thi', ' hi', 'thi', 'thi' ]
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Complete the regex `unRegex` so that it matches the strings `run`, `sun`, `fun`, `pun`, `nun`, and `bun`.
  2. Your regex should use the wildcard character.

### [ before ]
```sh
let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
```

### [ solution ]
```sh
let exampleStr = "Let's have fun with regular expressions!";
let unRegex = /.un/g; // Change this line
let result = unRegex.test(exampleStr);
console.log(result);
```

### [ output result ]
```sh
true
```

### [ Thoughts ]
  1. [`.`] - wildcard character will match any one character.
  2. use [`.`] to start a search text with unknown or end with unknown character
