# 014.Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

### [ Notes ]
  * destructure the object in a function argument itself.

#### example #1: destructures the object variable into the function itself:

```sh
const profileData = {
  name: "shalom",
  age: 35,
  nationality: "american",
  location: "earth"
};

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  console.log(name + " is on " + location);
}

profileUpdate(profileData);
```

#### output
```sh
shalom is on earth
```

#### example #2: destructures the object variable into the function itself:

```sh
const profileData = {
  name: "shalom",
  age: 35,
  nationality: "american",
  location: "earth"
};

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  console.log(name + " is on " + location + " and his age is " + age + ".");
}

profileUpdate(profileData);
```

#### output
```sh
shalom is on earth and his age is 35.
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Use destructuring assignment within the `argument` to the function `half` to send only `max` and `min` inside the function.

### [ before ]

```sh
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// Only change code below this line
const half = (stats) => (stats.max + stats.min) / 2.0; 
// Only change code above this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// Only change code below this line
const half = ({ max, min }) => ((max + min) / 2.0) ;

console.log( half(stats) );
console.log(stats)

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
28.015

{ max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85 }
```
