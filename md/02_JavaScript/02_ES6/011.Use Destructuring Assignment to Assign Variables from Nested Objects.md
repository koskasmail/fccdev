# 011.Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

### [ Notes ]
  * destructure values from nested objects.

#### extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

```sh
const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;

console.log(age + " " + email);
```

#### output
```sh
34 johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com
```

#### extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with different names:

```sh
const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
console.log(userAge + " " + userEmail);
```

#### output
```sh
34 johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment.
     It should still assign the variables `lowToday` and `highToday` the values of `today.low` and `today.high` from the `LOCAL_FORECAST` object.

### [ before ]

```sh
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

// Only change code below this line
  
const lowToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.low;
const highToday = LOCAL_FORECAST.today.high;

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
  yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
  today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
  tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
};

// Only change code below this line

const  {today: {low: lowToday, high: highToday}} = LOCAL_FORECAST;
console.log(lowToday ," " , highToday);

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
64   77
```

-----

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. destructure values from nested objects with or without the same variables name.
