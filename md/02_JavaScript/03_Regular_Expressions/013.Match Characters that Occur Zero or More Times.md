### [ Task ]
  1. For this challenge, `chewieQuote` has been initialized as the string `Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!` behind the scenes.
  2. Create a regex `chewieRegex` that uses the `*` character to match an uppercase `A` character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase a characters in `chewieQuote`.
  3. Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.


### [ before ]

```sh
// Only change code below this line
let chewieRegex = /change/; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
xxxx
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
xxxx
```
