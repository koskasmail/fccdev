# 026.Create a JavaScript Promise.md

### [ Notes ]
  * js promise is a promise to do something, usually asynchronously.
  * a promise have 2 result in a task, promise completes -or- promise failed.
  * Promise is a constructor function, so you need to use the new keyword to create one.
  * promise takes a function, as its argument, with two parameters - resolve and reject.
  * These are methods used to determine the outcome of the promise.

```sh
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

});
