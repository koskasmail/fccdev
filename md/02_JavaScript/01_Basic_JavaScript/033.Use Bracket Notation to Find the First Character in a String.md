# 033.Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

### [ Notes ]
  * `Bracket notation` is a way to get a character at a specific `index` within a string.
  * `index` within a string start with [0] 

#### example #1

```sh
const firstName = "jaron";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];

console.log(firstName + " :::start with letter::: " + firstLetter);
```

#### output
```sh
"jaron :::start with letter::: j"
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Use `bracket notation` to find the first character in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `firstLetterOfLastName`.
  *  Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

### [ before ]

```sh
// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
// Setup
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // Change this line

console.log(lastName + " start with letter" + firstLetterOfLastName);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
"Lovelace start with letterL"
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. racket notation` is a way to get a character at a specific `index` within a string.
