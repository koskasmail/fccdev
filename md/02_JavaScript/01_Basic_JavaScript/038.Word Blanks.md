# 038.Word Blanks

### [ Notes ]
  * A sentences with some missing words for you to fill.
  * fill the missing word (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). 

#### example #1

```sh
  ////It was really ____, and we ____ ourselves ____.

const myAdjectives = "hot"
const myVerbs = "laughed"
const myAdverbs = "silly";

const  sentence = "It was really " + myAdjectives + ", and we " + myVerbs + " ourselves " + myAdverbs + ".";

console.log(sentence);
```

#### output
```sh
"It was really hot, and we laughed ourselves silly."
```

### [ Task ]
  1. In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.
  2. You will need to use the string concatenation operator `+` to build a new string, using the provided variables: `myNoun`, `myAdjective`, `myVerb`, and `myAdverb`. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.
  3. You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.

### [ before ]

```sh
const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks = ""; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

// Only change code below this line
const wordBlanks = "I have a " + myAdjective + " " + myNoun + " that "+  myVerb + " very " + myAdverb; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line

console.log(wordBlanks);
```
