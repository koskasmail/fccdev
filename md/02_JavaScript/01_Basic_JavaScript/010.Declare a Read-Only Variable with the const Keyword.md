# 010.Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword.md

### [ Notes ]
  * `const` is a way to declare a variable as read only.
  * `const` assigned a value as he being declared, and then he became a `read-only` and cannot be changed.
  * trying to change a value in a const variable will result in an `error`.
  * Declare `const` variable name in `UPPERCASE`.

```sh
const PI = 3.14159265359;
PI = 14;
console.log(PI);
```

#### output
```sh
TypeError: "PI" is read-only
3.14159265359
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Change the code so that all variables are declared using `let` or `const`.
  2. Use `let` when you want the `variable` to change, and `const` when you want the variable to `remain constant`.
  3. Also, rename variables declared with `const` to conform to common practices. Do not change the `strings` assigned to the variables.

### [ before ]

```sh
var fCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
var fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(fCC, fact); // Change this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
freeCodeCamp is awesome!
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. const is a way to declare a variable as read only. 
  2. const variable will named in UPPERCASE.
