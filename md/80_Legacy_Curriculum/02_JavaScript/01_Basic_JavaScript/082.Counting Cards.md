# 082.Counting Cards

### [ Notes ]
  * Card Counting - In the casino game `Blackjack`, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck.
  * Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player.
  * Each card is assigned a value according to the table below.
  * When the count is positive, the player should bet high.
  * When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.
  * 

### [ Card Counting table ]
```sh
Count   Change	Cards
+1     	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0       7, 8, 9
-1      10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
```

### [ Task ]
  1. You will write a `card counting` function.
  2. It will receive a `card` parameter, which can be a `number` or a `string`, and increment or decrement the global `count` variable according to the card's value (see `Card Counting table`).
  3. The function will then return a string with the current count and the string `Bet` if the count is positive, or `Hold` if the count is zero or negative.
  4. The current count and the player's decision (`Bet` or `Hold`) should be separated by a single space.

### [ Card Counting table ]
```sh
Example Outputs:
-3
Hold

5
Bet
```

### [ Hint ]
  1. Do NOT reset `count` to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
  2. Do NOT return an array.
  3. Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output.

### [ before ]

```sh
let count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  // Only change code below this line


  return "Change Me";
  // Only change code above this line
}

cc(2); cc(3); cc(7); cc('K'); cc('A');
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
let count = 0;

function cc(card) {
  // Only change code below this line
  switch (card) {
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
    case 6:
      count++;
      break;
    case 7:
    case 8:
    case 9:
      count += 0;
      break;
    case 10:
    case "J":
    case "Q":
    case "K":
    case "A":    
      count--;
      break;
  }
  if (count > 0) {
    return (count + " Bet");
  }
  else
    return (count + " Hold");
  return count;
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(cc(2)); 
console.log(cc(3)); 
console.log(cc(7)); 
console.log(cc('K')); 
console.log(cc('A'));
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
1 Bet
2 Bet
2 Bet
1 Bet
0 Hold
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. The `counting cards` task come to show you how to use `switch...case` with multiple value (`String` or `numbers`).
