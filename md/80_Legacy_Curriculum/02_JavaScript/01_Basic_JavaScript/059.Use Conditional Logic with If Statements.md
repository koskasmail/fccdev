# 059.Use Conditional Logic with If Statements

### [ Notes ]
  * `if` statements are used to make decisions in code.
  * `if` conditions result as of Boolean conditions and return a value of `true` or `false`.

#### example #1

```sh
function fnAgeValidation(age) {
  var blAgeValidation = false;
  if (age >= 18)
    blAgeValidation = true;
  
  return blAgeValidation;
}

console.log(`Age 11 Validation is --> ${fnAgeValidation(11)} `);
console.log(`Age 19 Validation is --> ${fnAgeValidation(19)} `);
```

#### output
```sh
Age 11 Validation is --> false 
Age 19 Validation is --> true 
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Create an `if` statement inside the function to return `Yes, that was true` if the parameter `wasThatTrue` is `true` and return `No, that was false` otherwise.

### [ before ]

```sh
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
  // Only change code below this line

  if (wasThatTrue == true) {
    return "Yes, that was true";
  }
  return "No, that was false";

  // Only change code above this line

}

console.log(trueOrFalse(false));
console.log(trueOrFalse(true));
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
No, that was false
Yes, that was true
```
