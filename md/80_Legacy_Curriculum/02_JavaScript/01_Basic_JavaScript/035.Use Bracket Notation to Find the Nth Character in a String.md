# 035.Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

### [ Notes ]
  * `Bracket notation` is a way to get a character at a specific `index` within a string.
  * `index` within a string start with [0] 

#### example #1

```sh
const firstName = "jaron";
const firstLetter = firstName[2];

console.log(firstName + " letter in 2 is: " + firstLetter);
```

#### output
```sh
"jaron letter in 2 is: r"
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the `lastName` variable using bracket notation.
  * Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

### [ before ]

```sh
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line

console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
v
```

### [ Thoughts ]

  1. racket notation` is a way to get a character at a specific `index` within a string.
  2. `index` within a string start with [0].
