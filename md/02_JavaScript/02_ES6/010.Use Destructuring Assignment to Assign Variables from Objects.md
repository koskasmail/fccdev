# 010.Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects

### [ Notes ]
  * Destructuring to  assign a new variable name when extracting values. 

```sh
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;

console.log(userName + " " + userAge);
```
#### output
```sh
   John Doe 34
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment.
  2. It should still assign the variables `highToday` and `highTomorrow` the values of `today` and `tomorrow` from the `HIGH_TEMPERATURES` object.

### [ before ]

```sh
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line
  
const highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow; 

// Only change code above this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line

const {today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;

// Only change code above this line

console.log(highToday, " " + highTomorrow);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
77  80
```
