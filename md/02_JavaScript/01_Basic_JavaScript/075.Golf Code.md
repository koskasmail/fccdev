# 075.Golf Code

### [ Task ]
  - In the game of Golf, each hole has a `par`, meaning, the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play.
  - Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.
  - Your function will be passed `par` and `strokes` arguments.
  - Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

```sh
Strokes	        Return
1               "Hole-in-one!"
<= par - 2      "Eagle"
par - 1         "Birdie"
par             "Par"
par + 1         "Bogey"
par + 2         "Double Bogey"
>= par + 3      "Go Home!"
```

- `par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive.
- We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.

### [ before ]

```sh
const names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];

function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line


  return "Change Me";
  // Only change code above this line
}

golfScore(5, 4);
