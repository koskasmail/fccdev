# 010.Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword.md

### [ Notes ]
  * const is a way to declare a variable as read only.
  * const assigned a value as he being declared, and then he became a read-only and cannot be changed.
  * trying to change a value in a const variable will result in an error.

```sh
const PI = 3.14159265359;
PI = 14;
console.log(PI);
```
#### output
```sh
TypeError: "PI" is read-only
3.14159265359
```
