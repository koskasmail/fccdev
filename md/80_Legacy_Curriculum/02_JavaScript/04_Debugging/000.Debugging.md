## 000.Debugging

* Debugging is the process of going through the code to find the bugs/errors so you can trace them and fix them.

* Issues in code generally come in three forms: 
   * `syntax errors` - prevent your program from running, 
   * `runtime errors` - code execute in unexpected behavior.
   * `logical errors` -  code do somthing diffrent then expected.

* Debugging using browser `console` to find issues in code.
    * enter the browser console
        * `Developer tools` (ctrl+shift+i) or (F12)
