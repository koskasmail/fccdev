# 027.Escape Sequences in Strings

### [ Notes ]
  * Escape sequences allow you to use characters you can't use in a string.
  * `\'` - single quote.
  * `\"` - double quote.
  * `\\` - backslash.
  * `\n` - newline.
  * `\t` - tab.
  * `\r` - carriage return.
  * `\b` - backspace.
  * `\f` - form feed.

#### example #1

```sh
const output = "This\n is\n  \" jaron\'s \" space. "
console.log(output);
```

#### output
```sh
This
 is
  " jaron's " space. 
```

### [ Task ]
  1. Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable `myStr` using escape sequences.

```sh
FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine
```

2. You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.

3. Note: The indentation for `SecondLine` is achieved with the tab escape character, not spaces.

### [ before ]

```sh
const myStr = ""; // Change this line
```

### [ solution ]

```sh
const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line
console.log(myStr);
```

### [ output result ]

```sh
FirstLine
	\SecondLine
ThirdLine
```
